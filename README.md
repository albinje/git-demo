## Cobaya Tutorial


This is a tutorial for the cosmological parameter estimation with COBAYA.

#**Cobaya**

Cobaya (code for bayesian analysis, and Spanish for Guinea Pig) is a framework for sampling and statistical modelling: it allows you to explore an arbitrary prior or posterior using a range of Monte Carlo samplers (including the advanced MCMC sampler from CosmoMC, and the advanced nested sampler PolyChord). The results of the sampling can be analysed with GetDist. It supports MPI parallelization (and very soon HPC containerization with Docker/Shifter and Singularity).
